# Somfy-TaHoma-Developer-Mode-Python
A `python` script for requests to use a `local API` with `Somfy TaHoma gateways`.

You can also use the `get_devices()` function to list all devices. For example, you can use this to find out the RTS URL of a device and then add it to a smart home solution such as `openHAB` or `Home Assistant`.
